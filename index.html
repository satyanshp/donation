      <strong>Make a difference. Make a donation. </strong><br />Hope you and
      your family are safe and secure in your home. Please continue to Stay
      Home, Stay Safe to protect yourselves and your loved ones. Unfortunately,
      the less privileged, such as - daily wagers, the homeless and the
      economically backward are amongst the most vulnerable to be affected by
      this lockdown. To help the affected, you can now donate money to any of
      our partners and join the fight against COVID-19

      <strong>COVID Relief Fund</strong><br />Through this project, you can
      provide essential food items and Health Kits to poor and marginalised
      families in rural areas. These people are largely neglected and have
      little access to Covid related treatment and care. This campaign can help
      provide basic nutrition and vitamin and mineral tablets, dry fruits along
      with sanitary products like masks, gloves and sanitizers.

      <strong>Help patients breathe as they battle COVID</strong><br />
      Provide oxygen to help India breathe again. At the onset of the pandemic
      last year, when hospitals were facing a dire need for protective gear and
      equipment, we had responded in record time to stand strong beside our
      saviours, our healthcare heroes. The record increase of COVID positive
      patients and fatalities per day, lack of life-saving equipment like oxygen
      cylinders and concentrators, ventilators and Bipaps is crippling our
      healthcare infrastructure.
